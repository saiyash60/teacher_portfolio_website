        <h1>Vision and Mission</h1>
        <p>Through my teaching, research and art practice, I want to contribute towards a more dynamic view of history
            making - one that validates and empowers narratives from marginalized communities that have had little say
            on how they have been represented. This provides a space for creative dialogue to address
            politically-charged issues that matter to the community and facilitates their participation as informed
            global citizens and agents of social change. In an effort to surface new definitions of community history,
            creativity is essential. <br><br>

            I embrace a participatory, community-based approach that acknowledges the reality of disparities that are
            the result of current power dynamics in knowledge production and culture. Culture is fundamental to
            knowledge. As such, knowledge that recognizes, reacts to, and commends cultural differences can be the
            starting point to ensuring that marginalized narratives are also embedded in our collective history. This
            expands our understanding of “imposed invisibilities” on definitions of nationhood, citizenry, community and
            identity. This approach informs my memory work, where I explore ways we can effectively dismantle social
            injustice and collectively reimagine alternate futures. <br><br>

            My intention is to center socially engaged art as a way to increase community participation and interaction
            with social justice issues. By doing so, I hope to promote social change on an interpersonal and community
            level in academic and public discussions regarding social justice and how those excluded can best advocate
            for themselves. I seek to increase awareness and empathy through stories that amplify critical and
            difference-centered perspectives, challenge dominant views of power, and better serve our communities.</p>

                <div class="box" id="box1">
                    <p>That every child has unique inherent worth and value. Unfortunately, we tell huge numbers of
                        children and their parents that they are "defective" or failures because they aren't succeeding
                        based on a relatively narrow set measures used by schools. I don't believe that is the intention
                        of most involved in the education system, but it is certainly the outcome. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="box" id="box2">
                    <p>That learning and "learning how to learn" help us to lead better lives, to be better members of
                        our communities, and to build a better world. A large part of this is by recognizing and by
                        overcoming uninformed biases, overly-simplistic thinking, the entanglements of personal
                        interest, and cognitive traps.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box" id="box3">
                    <p>That education should not be something that we allow to be owned, controlled, or mandated by any
                        particular group, for as such it becomes a form of power and a means of enforcing compliance and
                        removing agency from others. Education, like democracy, should be seen as a process involving
                        the general public at all levels, and not seen as an dictated outcome.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="secondrow">
                <div class="box" id="box4">
                    <p>That active individual participation in decisions that affect us is a right, is a fulfillment of
                        our individual capabilities, and is a protection from abuses of power. Our narrative for
                        governance is democratic participation, and describes a process of open and engaged
                        decision-making at every level of society--the process of which is more important than the
                        particular decisions that are made. Our narrative for education should be the same: that
                        participation, self-direction, and active engagement are more important than mandated curricula,
                        and they should be taught and nourished. This is true for students, parents, and educators
                        alike.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box" id="box5">
                    <p>That agency - the ability to choose and act for oneself - is both the bedrock principle and our
                        highest aspiration for how we should treat others in a democratic and free society. The ultimate
                        goal of education should therefore be to develop the ability for students to take responsibility
                        for their own lives and become increasingly self-directed and productive, first for their own
                        benefit and then for the benefit of society as a whole. Systems of control and forced
                        compliance, rather than agency, are tempting shortcuts that have unfortunately become the basis
                        of many of our prominent educational philosophies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box" id="box6">
                    <p>That learning is a form of personal and community power, and that there is a direct connection
                        between independent thinking and the health of a free society. Our current expectations for
                        conformity and compliance, not limited to the educational sphere, ignore the value of diversity
                        and of civil dialog that are reflected in some of our most important institutions--witness the
                        balance of powers in our government and the right to a trial by jury in our legal system.
