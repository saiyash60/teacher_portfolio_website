        <h1>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</h1>
        <div class="entrep">
            <p>When I taught elementary and middle school, I made it a priority to ensure my students were able to
                connect the information they were learning in class with the real-world. At the time, teaching in this
                manner was not widely accepted. However, I knew that if my students couldn't take what they learned in
                class and apply it to their daily and future lives, I was not doing my job as an educator. <br><br>

                Looking back at those days, some of the strategies and lessons I taught may have been considered
                unnecessary by colleagues and school administrators. However, due to technology, learning was changing
                at a rapid pace. I took it upon myself to make sure I exposed my students to areas such as
                entrepreneurship, innovation, problem-solving, and critical thinking.Teaching, modeling, and engaging
                students in entrepreneurship opportunities, not only falls in line with many state curriculum standards,
                but also helps to prepare youth for future opportunities.<br><br>

                For example, entrepreneurship teaches students about money, investing, business strategies, loans, and
                creating budgets. At the same time, students can learn critical life skills such as
                problem-solving,brainstorming ideas, taking risks, facing failure and getting up again, setting goals,
                working together, and
                feeling comfortable to work individually. <br><br>

                Also, with the many unknowns in the future job market, itâ€™s crucial to teach students about
                opportunities they can build for themselves. There are many ways teachers can begin to shine a light on
                these skills within their curriculum. Instead of teacher-focused learning, students become drivers in
                their own
                education, and teachers become guiding passengers.Some students will demonstrate different talents in
                one area over another. Allow them to shine within their given abilities and talents, while adding in
                business elements.<br><br>

                If you are a teacher, here are five strategies you can easily use in your classroom to encourage
                life-long entrepreneurship skills.

                    <h2>Brainstorm Bins</h2>
                    <p>Set up a box in your class for brainstorming business ideas. You can use brainstorm bins as a way
                        to kick off the school year's most significant project. When you introduce this project early,
                        you are telling your students that you believe in them, their ideas, and that their voices
                        matter. You are also encouraging self-confidence while providing them with the space to own
                        their learning. Brainstorm bins can be the catalyst for creating and sharing ideas in a safe
                        place while encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills. They can also help
                        students to see the bigger picture because you can teach them how to set goals for a specific
                        period of time.</p>

                    <h2>Solution Boxes</h2>
                    <p> Sometimes, students will find things to complain about in school. Rather than encouraging them
                        to complain, set up a way for students to present their problems and to come up with solutions.
                        Encourage students to brainstorm ideas and present ways to fix concerning issues. Solution boxes
                        help students to speak up and create solutions rather than complain about them. Diving into
                        these solutions can also cultivate stronger relationships among students, provide a boost to
                        their self-esteem, and encourage problem-solving instead of complaining.

                    <h2>Shark Tank for kids</h2>
                    <p>If your school allows it, let students watch some episodes of Shark Tank, especially episodes
                        with younger entrepreneurs. If you do a quick Google search for the term, "Shark Tank kids," you
                        will find various Shark Tank videos with young people pitching their business ideas to the
                        Sharks. Watch some of these videos with your students, discuss them, and then build your own
                        Shark Tank competition at school. In addition to learning many crucial entrepreneurial skills,
                        your students can learn about investing, equity, creating products and services, building the
                        perfect pitch, and presenting in front of a large audience.</p>

                    <h2>Genious Hour</h2>
                    <p>According to the Genius Hour's website, Genius Hour is a movement that allows students to explore
                        their own passions while encouraging innovation and creativity in the classroom. This time
                        provides students with a choice in what they want to learn about or work on during a designated
                        hour in school.Google also implements Genius Hour into the workplace. These same genius hour
                        principles are applicable in the classroom. As an educator, if you have time in the day, you can
                        set up a certain amount of time for your students to work on passion projects.Your students may
                        be confused at first because this puts them in charge of their learning, rather than teachers
                        telling them what to do. If they struggle at the beginning, you can brainstorm topics with them
                        to get their imaginations brewing.Throughout the process, you act as a facilitator of projects
                        to ensure they stay on task.

                    <h2>TED-Ed Clubs</h2>
                    <p>If you are working with older students, encourage them to watch TEDx Teen Talks. TED Talks are
                        powerful ways to demonstrate and practice public speaking skills, share innovative ideas, as
                        well as provide the confidence some teens need to share their ideas. The TED-Ed project also
                        offers an official program that supports students from all over the world by joining a formal
                        TED-Ed club at school. In TED-Ed Clubs, students work in groups to discuss, innovate, and build
                        upon creative ideas. Club leaders receive TED-Ed's curriculum so they can guide their school's
                        projects, and inspire young TED speakers. Students from all over the world can discover,
                        exploreand learn how to present their innovative ideas in the form of TED talks. The official
                        site also brings students together from all over the world, connecting them to present and share
                        their ideas.</p>
