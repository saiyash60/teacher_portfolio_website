        <h1>Teaching Philosphy</h1>
        <p>For me, teaching is a calling. From my earliest childhood memories, I remember loving to play “school.” This
            love of the entire process of learning has followed me throughout the changes in my career path. In any
            role, regardless of whether I am acting in the formal roles of “instructor” or “student,” I seek to learn
            and to teach. <br><br>

            Education is my chosen career path. In my faculty and professional roles, I consider mentoring, supervising
            and teaching the next generation of thought and practice leaders to be a wonderful privilege. Giving back to
            the profession I love and believe in is one of the primary motivators behind my teaching. By teaching the
            teachers, I know that my work can have an impact on college students far beyond those with whom I have
            immediate contact.At its core, my teaching is grounded in concepts of student learning and development. Much
            as our profession has focused on the education of the whole student, I apply this philosophy to my teaching.
            My main goal in any teaching endeavor is to encourage the student to explore research and knowledge in order
            to incorporate it into their own professional point of view. Teaching in this field requires one to attend
            to both the technical knowledge a student needs and to their evolution as a reflective professional and
            person. Theory and practice are inextricably linked. <br><br>

            In encouraging this process, I believe it is important to view the student-teacher relationship as one that
            is co-constructed. In this regard, I am heavily influenced by the learning partnerships work of Dr. Marcia
            Baxter Magolda. Much as I hope students will learn from me, I equally appreciate the learning I take from my
            students. In the classroom space, I believe that authority and the responsibility for learning is mutually
            shared. <br><br>

            Part of this co-construction requires that I reflect on my own approach, style and biases in the learning
            process. It also requires that I recognize that students learn differently, have differing levels of
            learning abilities, and that my teaching must be sensitive to the individual needs of each student. In
            approaching my teaching, I attempt to accommodate the myriad of learning styles present in the classroom. I
            utilize a blend of approaches, including reading, writing, discussion, role play, case studies, reflection,
            and lecture. <br><br>

            Lastly, I view teaching as a performative act. Although I attempt to de-center myself in the classroom, I
            nevertheless recognize that teaching is, in part, a show. I relish the challenge of trying to take difficult
            concepts and explore them in accessible, interesting and engaging ways. I also strive to experiment with new
            innovative ways of engaging in the learning process. I am not the only one that benefits from this
            experimentation. My students do as well. <br><br>

            When it comes to education, the process is often the product, and I continually learn as I teach.
